  m_levelDescription: Our cameras have spotted several groups of slimes approaching
    from dark alleys. We have warned people by broadcasting messages about the situation,
    but we need Sotera to intervene. Oh, just so you know, some of the slimes look...
    different. They might be sturdier than usual. Proceed with caution.
