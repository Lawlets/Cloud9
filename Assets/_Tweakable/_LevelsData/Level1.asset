  m_levelDescription: Slimes have invaded the district's main street, causing people
    to flee and find shelter inside several shops. It seems that our gelatinous troublemakers
    came from the sewers. The police has evacuated most people and secured the perimeter,
    but they lack proper training to handle chemical threats and it's up to a Sotera
    team to clean up the street. Please help!
